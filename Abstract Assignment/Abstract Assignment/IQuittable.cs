//Create an interface called IQuittable and have it define a void method called Quit().

//Have your Employee class from the previous drill inherit that interface and implement the Quit() method in any way you choose.

//Use polymorphism to create an object of type IQuittable and call the Quit() method on it. Hint: an object can be of an interface type if it implements that specific interface.
